This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on FIFA player performance data and developing an interactive analytics dashboard to generate meaningful insights from raw sports statistics. 
The system analyzes key performance metrics such as goals, assists, passing accuracy, and minutes played to identify top-performing players and compare performance across different positions.
Using Python-based data analysis libraries like Pandas and NumPy, the project involves data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering, including calculated metrics such as Goals per 90 minutes to enable fair player comparison. Advanced visualization tools such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly are used to present statistical patterns and distributions, while Streamlit is used to build an interactive dashboard that allows users to dynamically filter and explore player data. 
This project demonstrates strong skills in data analysis, data visualization, dashboard development, and data storytelling, highlighting the ability to transform raw datasets into actionable insights that can support performance evaluation, sports analytics, and data-driven decision-making.
